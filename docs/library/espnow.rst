:mod:`espnow` --- Support for the ESP-NOW protocol
==================================================

.. module:: espnow
   :synopsis: ESP-NOW wireless protocol support

This module provides an interface to the
`ESP-Now
<https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.0.2/
api-reference/network/esp_now.html>`_
protocol provided by Espressif on ESP32 and ESP8266 devices. Some calls are only
available on the ESP32 due to code size restrictions on the ESP8266 and
differences in the Espressif API.

Load this module from the :doc:`esp` module. A simple example would be:

**Sender:** ::

        import network
        from esp import espnow

        # A WLAN interface must be active to send()/recv()
        w0 = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)  # Or network.AP_IF
        w0.active(True)

        e = espnow.ESPNow()
        e.init()
        peer = b'\xbb\xbb\xbb\xbb\xbb\xbb'   # MAC address of peer's wifi interface
        e.add_peer(peer)

        e.send("Starting...")       # Send to all peers
        for i in range(100):
            e.send(peer, str(i)*20, True)
        e.send(b'end')

**Receiver:** ::

        import network
        from esp import espnow

        # A WLAN interface must be active to send()/recv()
        w0 = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
        w0.active(True)

        e = espnow.ESPNow()
        e.init()
        peer = b'\xaa\xaa\xaa\xaa\xaa\xaa'   # MAC address of peer's wifi interface
        e.add_peer(peer)

        while True:
            host, msg = e.irecv()     # Available on ESP32 and ESP8266
            if msg:             # msg == None if timeout in irecv()
                print(host, msg)
                if msg == b'end':
                    break

.. note:: This module is still under development and its classes, functions,
          methods and constants are subject to change.

class ESPNow
------------

Constructor
-----------

.. class:: ESPNow()

    Returns the singleton ESPNow object. As this is a singleton, all calls to
    `espnow.ESPNow()` return a reference to the same object.

Configuration
-------------

.. method:: ESPNow.init()
            ESPNow.init([recv_bufsize])    (ESP8266 only)

    Prepare the software and hardware for use of the ESPNow communication
    protocol, including:

    - initialise the ESPNow data structures,
    - allocate the recv data buffer,
    - invoke esp_now_init() and
    - register the send and recv callbacks.

    **ESP8266**: The recv buffer size may be set as an argument to `init()` as
    there is no `config()` method on the ESP8266 (due to code size restrictions).

.. method:: ESPNow.deinit()

    De-initialise the Espressif ESPNow software stack (esp_now_deinit()),
    disable callbacks and deallocate the recv data buffer.

    **Note**: `deinit()` will also deregister all peers which must be
    re-registered after `init()`.

.. method:: ESPNow.config('param')
            ESPNow.config(param=value, ...)

    **Note:** ESP32 only - Use `init([recv_bufsize])<ESPNow.init()>` on the
    ESP8266.

    Get or set configuration values of the ESPNow interface. To get a value the
    parameter name should be quoted as a string, and just one parameter is
    queried at a time.  To set values use the keyword syntax, and one or more
    parameters can be set at a time.

    Currently supported values are:

    - ``rxbuf``: *(default=516)* Get/set the size in bytes of the internal
      buffer used to store incoming ESPNow packet data. The default size is
      selected to fit two max-sized ESPNow packets (250 bytes) with associated
      mac_address (6 bytes) and a message byte count (1 byte) plus buffer
      overhead. Increase this if you expect to receive a lot of large packets
      or expect bursty incoming traffic.

      **Note:** The recv buffer is only allocated by `ESPNow.init()`.
      Changing these values will have no effect until the next call of
      `ESPNow.init()`.

    - ``timeout``: *(default=300,000)* Default read timeout (in milliseconds).
      The timeout can also be provided as arg to `recv()` and `irecv()`.

.. method:: ESPNow.clear(True) (ESP32 only)

    Clear out any data in the recv buffer. Use this to clean
    up after receiving a ``Buffer error`` (should not happen). All data in the
    buffers will be discarded. An arg of `True` is required to guard against
    inadvertent use.

.. method:: ESPNow.set_pmk(pmk)

    Set the Primary Master Key (PMK) which is used to encrypt the Local Master
    Keys (LMK) for encrypting ESPNow data traffic. If this is not set, a default
    PMK is used by the underlying Espressif esp_now software stack. The ``pmk``
    argument bust be a byte string of length `espnow.KEY_LEN` (16 bytes). Note:
    messages will only be encrypted if ``lmk`` is set in `ESPNow.add_peer()`
    (see
    `Security
    <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/network/esp_now.html#security>`_
    ).

Sending and Receiving Data
--------------------------

A wifi interface (``network.STA_IF`` or ``network.AP_IF``) must be
`active()<network.WLAN.active>` before messages can be sent or received,
but it is not necessary to connect or configure the WLAN interface.
For example::

    import network

    w0 = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
    w0.active(True)

.. method:: ESPNow.send(mac, msg, [sync=True])
            ESPNow.send(msg)    (ESP32 only)

    Send the data contained in ``msg`` to the peer with given network ``mac``
    address. In the second form, ``mac=None`` and ``sync=True``. The peer must
    be registered with `ESPNow.add_peer()<ESPNow.add_peer()>` before the
    message can be sent.

    Arguments:

    - ``mac``: byte string exactly 6 bytes long or ``None``
    - ``msg``: string or byte-string such that
      ``0<len(msg)<=espnow.MAX_DATA_LEN`` (250) bytes
    - ``sync``:

      - ``True``: (default) send ``msg`` to the peer and wait for a response
        (or not). Returns ``False`` if any peers fail to respond.

      - ``False`` handover ``msg`` to the esp_now software stack for
        transmission and return immediately.
        Responses from the peers will be discarded.
        Always returns ``True``.

    If ``mac`` is ``None`` (ESP32 only) the message will be sent to all
    registered peers, except any broadcast or multicast MAC addresses.

    **Note**: A peer will respond with success if its wifi interface is
    `active()<network.WLAN.active>` and set to the same channel as the sender,
    regardless of whether it has initialised it's ESP-Now system or is
    actively listening for ESP-Now traffic (see the Espressif ESP-Now docs).

    **Note**: See `Exceptions`_ below for a description of the exceptions
    which may be raised.

.. method:: ESPNow.recv([timeout]) (ESP32 only)

    **Note:** ESP32 only. Use `irecv()` on the esp8266.

    Wait for an incoming message and return:

    - ``(None, None)`` if ``timeout`` is reached before a message is received, or

    - ``(mac, message)``: a newly allocated tuple of `bytearray` where:

      - ``mac`` is the mac address of the sending device (peer) and

      - ``msg`` is the message/data sent from the peer.

    ``timeout`` optionally sets a timeout (in milliseconds) for the read. The
    default timeout (5 minutes) can be set on the ESP32 using `ESPNow.config()`.

    **Note**: repeatedly calling `recv()<ESPNow.recv()>` will exercise the
    micropython memory allocation as new storage is allocated for each new
    message and tuple. Use `irecv()<ESPNow.irecv()>`
    for a more memory-efficient option.

.. method:: ESPNow.irecv([timeout])

    Wait for an incoming message and return a `callee-owned tuple` of:

    - ``(None, None)`` if ``timeout`` is reached before a message is received, or

    - ``(mac, message)``: a tuple of `bytearray` where:

      - ``mac`` is the mac address of the sending device (peer) and

      - ``msg`` is the message/data sent from the peer.

    ``timeout`` optionally sets a timeout (in milliseconds) for the read. The
    default timeout (5 minutes) can be set on the ESP32 using `ESPNow.config()`.

    **Note**: Equivalent to `recv()<ESPNow.recv()>`, except that
    `irecv()<ESPNow.irecv()>` will
    return a `callee-owned tuple` of bytearrays.
    That is, memory will be allocated once for the tuple and bytearrays on
    invocation of `espnow.ESPNow()<ESPNow()>` and reused for subsequent calls to
    `irecv()<ESPNow.irecv()>`. You must make copies if you
    wish to keep the values across subsequent calls to `irecv()<ESPNow.irecv()>`.
    So, `irecv()<ESPNow.irecv()>` is more memory efficient than
    `recv()<ESPNow.recv()>` on memory constrained microcontrollers like the
    ESP32 and ESP8266.

    On timeout, `irecv()` will return ``(None, None)`` and set the length of the
    callee-owned ``message`` bytearray to zero.

.. method:: ESPNow.poll() (ESP32 only)

    Return ``True`` if data is available to be read with ``recv()/irecv()``.
    Return ``False`` otherwise.

.. method:: ESPNow.stats() (ESP32 only)

    Return a 5-tuple containing the number of packets sent/received/lost::

    (sent_packets, sent_responses, sent_failures, recv_packets, dropped_recv_packets)

    Incoming packets are *dropped* when the recv buffers are full. To reduce
    packet loss, increase the ``rxbuf`` config parameters and ensure you are
    in a tight loop calling `irecv()<ESPNow.irecv()>` as quickly as possible.

    **Note**: Dropped packets will still be acknowledged to the sender as
    received.

Broadcasts
----------

All active ESP-Now clients accept messages sent to their MAC address or to the
``broadcast`` MAC address (``b'\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff\\xff'``) or any
multicast MAC address.

To `send()<ESPNow.send()>` a broadcast message, the ``broadcast``
MAC address must first be registered using `add_peer()<ESPNow.add_peer()>`.
`send()<ESPNow.send()>` will always return ``True`` for broadcasts, regardless
of whether any devices receive the message. It is not permitted to encrypt
messages sent to the ``broadcast`` address or any multicast address.

**Note**: `ESPNow.send(None, msg)<ESPNow.send()>` will send to all registered
peers *except* the broadcast address. To send a broadcast message, you must
specify the ``broadcast`` MAC address as the peer.

Iteration over ESPNow
---------------------

**Note**: ESP32 only

It is also possible to read messages by iterating over the ESPNow singleton
object. This will yield ``(mac, message)`` tuples using the alloc-free
`irecv()` method, eg::

        for msg in e:
            print(f"Recv: mac={msg[0]}, message={msg[1]}")

**Note**: Iteration will yield ``None`` if the default timeout expires waiting
for a message.

Peer Management
---------------

The Esspresif ESP-Now software requires that other devices (peers) must be
*registered* before we can `send()<ESPNow.send()>` them messages.

.. method:: ESPNow.add_peer(mac, [lmk], [channel], [ifidx], [encrypt])
            ESPNow.add_peer(mac, param=value, ...)   (ESP32 only)

    Add/register the provided ``mac`` address (a 6-byte byte-string) as a peer
    under the ESPNow protocol. The following "peer info" parameters may also be
    specified as positional or keyword arguments:

    - ``lmk``: The Local Master Key (LMK) key used to encrypt data transfers
      with this peer (if the *encrypt* parameter is set to *True*). Must be:

      - a byte-string of length ``espnow.KEY_LEN`` (16 bytes), or
      - any non-`True` python value (default= ``b''``), signifying an *empty* key
        which will disable encryption.

    - ``channel``: The wifi channel (2.4GHz) to communicate with this peer. Must
      be an integer from 0 to 14. If channel is set to 0 the current channel
      of the wifi device will be used. (default=0)

    - ``ifidx``: *(ESP32 only)* Index of the wifi interface which will be used
      to send data to this peer. Must be an integer set to
      ``network.STA_IF`` (=0) or ``network.AP_IF`` (=1).
      (default=0/``network.STA_IF``).

    - ``encrypt``: *(ESP32 only)* If set to ``True`` data exchanged with this
      peer will be encrypted with the PMK and LMK. (default=``False``)

    **ESP8266**: Keyword args may not be used on the ESP8266.

    **Note**: Managing peers can become complex on the ESP32/8266 if you are
    using more than just the STA_IF interface. The ESP32/8266 effectively has
    two **apparently** independent wifi interfaces (STA_IF and AP_IF) and each
    has their own MAC address (see `ESPNow and Wifi`_ below). You must:

    - choose the correct MAC address of the remote peer (STA_IF or AP_IF) to
      register,

    - register it with the correct local interface (``ifidx`` = STA_IF or AP_IF),
      and

    - ensure the correct interfaces are ``active(True)`` on the local and remote
      peer.

    `ESPNow.send()<ESPNow.send()>` will raise an
    ``OSError('ESP_ERR_ESPNOW_IF')``
    exception when trying to send a message to a peer which is registered to a
    local interface which is not ``active(True)``. Note also that both
    interfaces may be active simultaneously, leading to a lot of flexibility
    in configuring ESPNow and Wifi networks.

.. method:: ESPNow.get_peer(mac) (ESP32 only)

    Return a 5-tuple of the "peer info" associated with the ``mac`` address::

        (mac, lmk, channel, ifidx, encrypt)

.. method:: ESPNow.peer_count() (ESP32 only)

    Return the number of peers which have been registered.

.. method:: ESPNow.get_peers() (ESP32 only)

    Return the "peer info" parameters for all the registered peers (as a tuple
    of tuples).

.. method:: ESPNow.mod_peer(mac, lmk, [channel], [ifidx], [encrypt]) (ESP32 only)
            ESPNow.mod_peer(mac, 'param'=value, ...) (ESP32 only)

    Modify the parameters of the peer associated with the provided ``mac``
    address. Parameters may be provided as positional or keyword arguments.

.. method:: ESPNow.del_peer(mac)

    Deregister the peer associated with the provided ``mac`` address.

Stream IO interface
-------------------

**Note**: ESP32 only

**Note**: The ESPNow buffer packet format is not yet fully documented. It
will be supported by a python support module for reading and sending ESPNow
message packets through the ``stream`` interface.

EspNow also supports the micropython ``stream`` io interface. This is intended
to help support high throughput low-copy transfers and also to support
``uasyncio`` through the StreamReader interface. ESPNow includes
support for the following python
`stream interface <https://docs.python.org/3/library/io.html>`_ methods:

.. method:: ESPNow.read([size=-1])

    Return up to ``size`` bytes read from the espnow recv buffers as a byte
    string. Is nonblocking and returns None if no data available. The returned
    data is a stream of ESPNow buffer packet data.

.. method:: ESPNow.read1([size=-1])

    As for `read()` but will return after at most one packet is read.

.. method:: ESPNow.readinto(b)

    Read bytes into a pre-allocated, writable bytes-like object (eg. bytearray)
    and return the number of bytes read. Is nonblocking and returns None if no
    data available.

.. method:: ESPNow.readinto1(b)

    As for `readinto()` but will return after at most one packet is read.

.. method:: ESPNow.write(b)

    Write the given bytes-like object to the ESPNow interface. ``b`` must
    contain a sequence of ESPNow buffer packet data.

`ESPNow` also supports the ``poll.poll`` and ``poll.ipoll`` calls, so users
may wait on received events.

Supporting ``uasyncio``
-----------------------

**Note**: ESP32 only

`ESPNow` uses the ``stream`` io interface to support the micropython
``uasyncio`` module for asynchronous IO. A ``StreamReader`` class may be
constructed from an ESPNow object and used to support async IO. Eg::

        s = StreamReader(e)

        async def areadespnow(s):
            while e.send(b'ping'):
                msg = await(s.read1())
                if msg[8:] != b'pong'
                    break

Constants
---------

**Note**: ESP32 only

.. data:: espnow.MAX_DATA_LEN         (=250)
          espnow.KEY_LEN              (=16)
          espnow.MAX_TOTAL_PEER_NUM   (=20)
          espnow.MAX_ENCRYPT_PEER_NUM (=6)

Exceptions
----------

If the underlying Espressif ESPNow software stack returns an error code,
the micropython ESPNow module will throw an ``OSError(errnum, errstring)``
exception where ``errstring`` is set to the name of one of the error codes
identified in the
`Espressif ESP-Now docs
<https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.0.2/
api-reference/network/esp_now.html#api-reference>`_.

Some of these error string values include:

- ``'ESP_ERR_ESPNOW_NOT_INIT``: The ESPNow interface has not been
  initialised (see `ESPNow.init()<ESPNow.init()>`).
- ``'ESP_ERR_ESPNOW_NOT_FOUND'``: The peer mac address
  has not been registered (see `ESPNow.add_peer()<ESPNow.add_peer()>`).
- ``'ESP_ERR_ESPNOW_IF'``: The wifi interface (STA_IF or
  AP_IF) registered for the peer is not `active()<network.WLAN.active>`.
  Use `ESPNow.get_peer(mac)<ESPNow.get_peer()>` to confirm which interface
  is registered.
- ``'ESP_ERR_ESPNOW_NO_MEM'``: Allow time for ESPNow buffers to be drained
  and try again.
- ``'ESP_ERR_ESPNOW_FULL'``: The maximum number of peers are already registered.
- ``'ESP_ERR_ESPNOW_EXIST'``: Attempt to call ``add_peer()`` for a peer which
  is already registered.

Example::

    try:
        e.send(peer, 'Hello')
    except OSError as err:
        if len(err.args) < 2:
            raise err
        if err.args[1] == 'ESP_ERR_ESPNOW_NOT_INIT':
            e.init()
        elif err.args[1] == 'ESP_ERR_ESPNOW_NOT_FOUND'
            e.add_peer(peer)
        elif err.args[1] == 'ESP_ERR_ESPNOW_IF'
            network.WLAN(network.STA_IF).active(True)
        else:
            raise err

ESPNow and Wifi
---------------

ESPNow messages may be sent and received on any `active()<network.WLAN.active>`
`WLAN<network.WLAN()>` interface (``network.STA_IF`` or ``network.AP_IF``),
even if that interface is also connected to a wifi network or configured as
an access point. However, sending ESPNow packets to a STA_IF interface which
is also connected to a wifi access point (AP) is much less reliable.
This is due to the default power saving mode (WIFI_PS_MIN_MODEM) of the
ESP32 when connected to an AP.

There are several options to improve reliability of receiving ESPNow packets when
also connected to a wifi network:

1. Disable the power-saving mode on the STA_IF interface:

  - Use ``WLAN(STA_IF).config(ps_mode=WIFI_PS_NONE)``
  - This requires the ESPNow patches on ESP32 (not supported in micropython v1.15).

2. Use the AP_IF interface to send/receive ESPNow traffic:

  - Register all peers with ``e.add_peer(peer, lmk, channel, network.AP_IF)``
  - Configure peers to send messages to the ``AP_IF`` mac address
  - This will also activate the ESP32 as an access point!

3. Configure ESPNow clients to retry sending messages.

**Example 1:** Disable power saving mode on STA_IF::

  import network
  from esp import espnow

  peer = b'0\xaa\xaa\xaa\xaa\xaa'        # MAC address of peer
  e = espnow.ESPNow()
  e.init()

  w0 = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
  w0.active(True)
  w0.connect('myssid', 'myppassword')
  while not w0.isconnected():            # Wait until connected...
      time.sleep(0.1)
  w0.config(ps_mode=network.WIFI_PS_NONE)  # ..then disable power saving

  e.add_peer(peer)                       # Register peer on STA_IF
  e.send(peer, b'ping')                  # Message will be from STA_IF mac address

  print('Send me messages at:', w0.config('mac'))

**Example 2:** Send and receive ESPNow traffic on AP_IF interface::

  import network
  from esp import espnow

  peer = b'feedee'                       # MAC address of peer
  e = espnow.ESPNow()
  e.init()

  w0 = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
  w0.config(channel=6)
  w0.active(True)
  w0.connect('myssid', 'myppassword')

  w1 = network.WLAN(network.AP_IF)
  w1.config(hidden=True)                 # AP_IF operates on same channel as STA_IF
  w1.active(True)

  e.add_peer(peer, None, None, network.AP_IF)  # Register peer on AP_IF
  e.send(peer, b'ping')                  # Message will be from AP_IF mac address

  print('Send me messages at:', w1.config('mac'))

Other issues to take care with when using ESPNow with wifi are:

- If using the ESP32 Access Point (AP_IF) while also connected to another
  Access Point (on STA_IF), the AP_IF will always operate on the same channel
  as the STA_IF regardless of the channel you set for the AP_IF
  (see
  `Attention Note 3
  <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/network/esp_wifi.html#_CPPv419esp_wifi_set_config16wifi_interface_tP13wifi_config_t>`_
  ).

- Some versions of the ESP IDF only permit sending ESPNow packets from the
  STA_IF interface to peers which have been registered on the same wifi
  channel as the STA_IF::

    ESPNOW: Peer channel is not equal to the home channel, send fail!

- Some versions of the ESP IDF don't permit setting the channel of the STA_IF
  at all, other than by connecting to an Access Point (This seems to be fixed
  in IDF 4+). Micropython versions without the ESPNow patches also disallow
  setting the channel of the STA_IF.

ESPNow and Sleep Modes
----------------------

The ``machine.lightsleep([time_ms])`` and ``machine.deepsleep([time_ms])``
functions can be used to put the ESP32 and periperals (including the WiFi and
Bluetooth radios) to sleep. This is useful in many applications to conserve
battery power (see :doc:`machine`). However, applications must disable the
Wifi peripheral (using ``active(False)``) before entering light or deep
sleep (see `Sleep Modes <https://docs.espressif.com/
projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/system/sleep_modes.html>`_).
Otherwise the WiFi radio may not be initialised properly after wake from
sleep. If the ``STA_IF`` and ``AP_IF`` interfaces have both been set
``active(True)`` then both interfaces should be set ``active(False)`` before
entering any sleep mode.

**Example:** deep sleep::

  import network
  import machine
  from esp import espnow

  peer = b'0\xaa\xaa\xaa\xaa\xaa'        # MAC address of peer
  e = espnow.ESPNow()
  e.init()

  w0 = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
  w0.active(True)
  e.add_peer(peer)                       # Register peer on STA_IF

  print('Sending ping...')
  if not e.send(peer, b'ping'):
    print('Ping failed!')

  e.deinit()
  w0.active(False)                       # Disable the wifi before sleep

  print('Going to sleep...')
  machine.deepsleep(10000)               # Sleep for 10 seconds then reboot

**Example:** light sleep::

  import network
  import machine
  from esp import espnow

  peer = b'0\xaa\xaa\xaa\xaa\xaa'        # MAC address of peer
  e = espnow.ESPNow()
  e.init()

  w0 = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
  w0.active(True)
  w0.config(channel=6)
  e.add_peer(peer)                       # Register peer on STA_IF

  while True:
    print('Sending ping...')

Notes on using on_recv callbacks
--------------------------------

The `ESPNow.config(on_recv=callback)<ESPNow.config()>` callback method is a
convenient and responsive way of processing incoming espnow messages,
especially if the data rate is moderate and the device is *not too busy* but
there are some caveats:

- The scheduler stack *can* easily overflow and callbacks will be missed if
  packets are arriving at a sufficient rate. It is a good idea to readout all
  available packets in the callback in case a prior callback has been missed,
  eg::

    def recv_cb2(e):
        while e.poll():
            print(e.irecv(0))
    e.config(on_recv=recv_cb2)

- Message callbacks may still be missed if the scheduler stack is
  overflowed by other micropython components (eg, bluetooth,
  machine.Pin.irq(), machine.timer, i2s, ...). Generally, this method may be
  less reliable for dealing with intense bursts of messages, or high
  throughput or on a device which is very busy dealing with other hardware
  operations.

- Take care if reading out messages with `irecv()` in the normal micropython
  control flow *and* in ``on_recv`` callbacks, as the memory returned by
  `irecv()` is shared.

- For more information on *scheduling* function callbacks see:
  `micropython.schedule()<micropython.schedule>`.
